- write the logic for the computer choice
1. Plan or pseudocode your solution.

//let the math.random operator make a number between 1 and 3.

//if num == 1
//return result = rock

//if num == 2
//return result = paper

//if num == 3
//return result == scissors

2. Write the code.

function getComputerChoice() {
    let num = Math.floor(Math.random()*3)
    return num
}
3. Test your code to make sure it works.

--------------------------------------
Make a function called "getHumanChoice"
1. Plan your solution.
//a prompt asking: 
//"what is you choice?
//rock, paper or scissors."


2. Pseudocode your solution
function getHumanChoice
	let result = prompt "what is you choice?
		rock, paper or scissors."
	
	return result

3. Write the code.



4. Test your code to make sure it works.

function playround
1. Plan your solution.

when a round is played, I want to collect what the computer chose
and what the human chose. 
After that I want to compare these results.
rock wins from scissors
paper wins from rock
scissors wins from paper
if both choose rock, you both chose the same. 
if both chose paper, you both chose the same.
if both chose scissors, you both chose the same.

2. Pseudocode your solution

function with the parameters computerchoice and humanchoice
	if computerchoice = rock and humanchoice = scissors, computer wins
	if humanchoice = rock and computerchoice = scissors, human wins
	if computerchoice = paper and humanchoice = rock, computer wins
	if humanchoice = paper and computerchoice = rock, human wins
	if computerchoice = scissors and humanchoice = paper, computer wins
	if humanchoice = scissors and computerchoice = paper, human wins
	if both choose rock, you both chose the same. 
	if both chose paper, you both chose the same.
	if both chose scissors, you both chose the same.
